# AcademicHub Frontend Setup Guide

## Prerequisites: Ensure Backend is Installed and Set Up

Before starting with the frontend, make sure the backend is ready:

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AcademicHubOrg/AcademicHub.git
```

### Set Up backend services
Follow the backend setup instructions in the [AcademicHub README](https://github.com/AcademicHubOrg/AcademicHub/blob/main/README.md).

## Setting Up the Frontend on React

### Step 1: Create a New Project in Your IDE
- Open your IDE.
- Create a new project.
- Wait until all the components install and you see "Happy hacking!" message in terminal.

### Step 2: Access the Frontend Directory
- Navigate to the frontend directory within the cloned repository in your IDE.

### Step 3: Install Node Package Manager (npm)
- Execute the following command in your terminal to install npm:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Start the Frontend Application
- To run the frontend, use:
```bash
npm start
```
- You also use the 'start' button in the npm toolbar if your IDE has one.

# You're All Set!

You are now ready to contribute to the AcademicHub project. Happy coding!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
